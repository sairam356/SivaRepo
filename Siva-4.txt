Interface Concept in java 8


 interface  A{
       
    abstract method declartion
    public void m1();//abstract

    we can write static methhod
 
   public static String getName(){


     return "My Name is Chatinya ";
   }


   default String getMyPhoneNUmber(){

  
   }


}

 interface C extends A{
   public void m3();

 }

 For interface we cannot create  object 

class B implements C{
  B(int a);
public void m1(){


}

public void m3(){


}

   A a1 = new B(1);
   a1.m1();


}


Interface variables are static and final by default in Java, Why?
Interface variables are static because java interfaces cannot be instantiated on their own. The value of the variable must be assigned in a static context in which no instance exists.
The final modifier ensures the value assigned to the interface variable is a true constant that cannot be re-assigned.
========================
FunctionInterface



 If  interface contaiins only one abstract method , any no  of static methods and default method

then it is called fucntionIterface.
