Dear Sir,

as you know  my Car (Registration No. ABC-000) which has been insured by your company vide Insurance Policy No. (Policy number-0000) has had an accident on

Feb26 at Aholbila muttu tirumula .

  On Feb25 with my family, I went to formula and I stayed at ahobila muttu and parked my car in the parking slot. In Morning ie; ON feb26 I want to get 
the car out from 

parking move to another place. Before moving the car from the parking lot I started my car and wear the seat blet, observed my surrounding ie; 
I see in front there is a big wall and there is multiple car's parked side by side and there is no way to go front.
 
I need to come back and also a lot of noise and sound is there,  outside a marriage happening in Ahobila muttu . 
I Still started the car, I gave reverse  gear and In the meantime, I went to neutral and adjusted the wheel unfortunately, the gear went to

drive mode, as the leg is on the accelerator, I hit my car to the wall and there is a vehicle which is present left side to us, I hit to vehicle too.

So the left side of my car hit another vehicle, and the right side front bumper hit to wall. I immediately move the car out from parking slowly
 and the other vehicle moved from there. And I checked the damage.

I see <car damaged> at these places.  At the accident, we took some pictures with Google Map camera, which will help us with the accident
 location, which parts damaged at the point.


I request you to get the claim of insurance, so that my car is in a perfect condition again.
